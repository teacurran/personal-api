# personal-api

This is an application that will be for aggregating data from several sources into a single API.

This was inspired by http://api.naveen.com/

This project is not intended to ever be finished but is a testing ground for Java techniques and libraries.

.Currently this project incorporates the following technologies:
* Maven
* Java EE7
* Wildfly 8.2
* JPA2
* Arquillian
* RestEasy
* MyBatis Migrations

## Building and Running

.Prerequisites
* MySQL
* Apache Maven
* Java 8

.To get up and running:
1. Create a MySQL database called personalapi
2. Set your MySQL username/password to root/root
3. From the command line, change to personal-api-db directory
4. run the command: mvn migration:up
5. from the base directory, run the command: mvn package
6. take the build war file from ./target/ and deploy it to WildFly 8

Notes:
IDE builders may not properly run Grunt.
If you are getting stylesheets missing from the assembled war this is probably the case.

If there is an error with compass, you may have to instll the compass gem into your local Ruby.
